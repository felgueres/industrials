# American Techno-materialism

## :coffee: Background
The goal is to build an understanding of American Industrials as a system. If the cost of manufacturing asymptotically approaches the cost of raw materials plus intellectual property (Elon's idea), drawing a system boundary around materials is a good place to start.  

### Global Developments

Moore's Law. Every two years, transistor capacity doubles on ICs.

Law of accelerating returns. Rate of change in information technology systems increase exponentially.



### 

**US Departments**

1/ Defense (Army, Navy, Airforce) 

**Defense Technologies**

Accessible to private innovation. Trend is towards surveillance and reconnaissance relating to autonomous vehicles. 
Examples:
- Anduril (surveillance and reconnaissance)
- Shield AI (mft autonomous drones for surveillance and patrolling)
- Epirus (counter UAV systems, precision detection systems to detect unauthorized vessels, smart control of energy power)
- Dedrone (counter drone platform) 

Space stack
- Launch
- Satellite operators
- Supply chain & manufacturing 
- Next gen: space logistics, eg. increase asset lifetime, refuel, move

**Offense Technologies**

Not accessible to private innovation. Trend towards electric UAVs.

2/ Transportation
- Personal: 
- Air: 
- Railway: Parallel Systems (electric, ex-Tesla engineers)
- Subterranean: Boring company (safe, fast-to-dig, low-cost transport, freight tunnels)
- Sea: Boundary Layer Technologies (electric, hydrofoiling containerships)

3/ Agriculture 

3/ Energy 

4/ Urban Development 

5/ Homeland Security 

6/ Commerce 
- Flexport (freight sheduler by air, ocen, rail and truck)

7/ Justice  

8/ Treasury  

9/ Health and Human Services  

10/ Veteran Affairs
