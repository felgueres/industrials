# Materialism 

## :coffee: Background
The goal is to build an understanding of American Industrials as a system. If the cost of manufacturing asymptotically approaches the cost of raw materials plus intellectual property (Elon's idea), drawing a system boundary around materials is a good place to start.  

### Global Developments

Moore's Law. Every two years, transistor capacity doubles on ICs.

Law of accelerating returns. Rate of change in information technology systems increase exponentially.

By 2050, energy consumption will increase by 80% (OECD 2012).

Lack of meaning (nihilism)
- The lack of god -- even if culturally -- left the west devoid of meaning. 
- For technologists, partially filled by the aspirational technologies of AGI and Mars, the new frontier.
- Junkspace portrays a generalized type of building, which according to Koolhas appears all over the planet, uniting everything into "a seamless patchwork of the permanently disjointed". Junkspace is the entropic offspring of disoriented global activity, the fatal triumph of quantity over quality.
- There is an incompetence to use new technology to create spatial meaning and identity. Koolhas, Junkspace
- Architecture has become superficial and shallow, focuses on formal appearance rather than its larger purpose. Koolhas, Junkspace

From mass production to mass customization
- Mass production made way to standardization and loss of complexity (information)
- Modernity has led to a superficiality of forms. It introduces rules that allows filtering and comparing. Evaluating comprehensible characteristics is fast and manageable method to process information. Standardization, repetition, regularity, leads to loss of information.

### 

**US Departments**

1/ Defense (Army, Navy, Airforce) 

**Defense Technologies**

Accessible to private innovation. Trend is towards surveillance and reconnaissance relating to autonomous vehicles. 
Examples:
- Anduril (surveillance and reconnaissance)
- Shield AI (mft autonomous drones for surveillance and patrolling)
- Epirus (counter UAV systems, precision detection systems to detect unauthorized vessels, smart control of energy power)
- Dedrone (counter drone platform) 

Space stack
- Launch
- Satellite operators
- Supply chain & manufacturing 
- Next gen: space logistics, eg. increase asset lifetime, refuel, move

**Offense Technologies**

Not accessible to private innovation. Trend towards electric UAVs.

2/ Transportation
- Personal: 
- Air: 
- Railway: Parallel Systems (electric, ex-Tesla engineers)
- Subterranean: Boring company (safe, fast-to-dig, low-cost transport, freight tunnels)
- Sea: Boundary Layer Technologies (electric, hydrofoiling containerships)

3/ Agriculture 

3/ Energy 

4/ Urban Development 

5/ Homeland Security 

6/ Commerce 
- Flexport (freight sheduler by air, ocen, rail and truck)

7/ Justice  

8/ Treasury  

9/ Health and Human Services
