# Industrial Materialism 

## :thought_balloon: Background

The goal of this project is to build an understanding of America's manufacturing stock at the boundary of its inputs and, in the context of accelerating development of new technology.

1/ Can we influence new products from the sourcing of raw materials?

2/ What arrangement of atoms could you do at the source to facilitate their later transformation? 

3/ Is there an equivalent of a staging environment for materials?

### :earth_americas: Global Developments

Moore's Law. Every two years, transistor capacity doubles on ICs.

Law of accelerating returns. Rate of change in information technology systems increase exponentially.

By 2050, energy consumption will increase by 80% (OECD 2012).

#### From mass production to mass customization
- Mass production made way to standardization and loss of complexity (information)
- Modernity has led to a superficiality of forms. It introduces rules that allows filtering and comparing. Evaluating comprehensible characteristics is fast and manageable method to process information. Standardization, repetition, regularity, leads to loss of information.
- Historically, there has always been a problem of productivity vs. product changes. GM shortened the gap with Ford, when they decided to introduce yearly model changes. Reliable and scalable is no longer enough, it must adapt -- with shortening periodicity -- to new market demands.
- 

#### Lack of meaning (nihilism)
- The lack of god -- even if culturally -- left the west devoid of meaning. 
- For technologists, partially filled by the aspirational technologies of AGI and Mars, the new frontier.
- Junkspace portrays a generalized type of building, which according to Koolhas appears all over the planet, uniting everything into "a seamless patchwork of the permanently disjointed". Junkspace is the entropic offspring of disoriented global activity, the fatal triumph of quantity over quality.
- There is an incompetence to use new technology to create spatial meaning and identity. Koolhas, Junkspace
- Architecture has become superficial and shallow, focuses on formal appearance rather than its larger purpose. Koolhas, Junkspace

#### Architecture angle
- Reciprocal influence between form and material. Implies that a focus on surface rather than material's intrinsic properties is directly linked to CAD tools (Jeska)
- New production methods have "robbed the architectural shape of its material dimension and only during manufacturing finds a reference back to the material" (Jeska)
- Insists that dynamic processes should under no means end with the completion of a building (Oosterhuis, TU Delft Professor). Finally, we'll move to buildings that become liquid, not static, and not only metaphorically in the design process. Flexible, dynamic, in form and structure.
  - Intrinsic properties. 
  - Over the air digital updates. Change bodies and shape in real-time
  - In land updates.

**US Departments**

1/ Defense (Army, Navy, Airforce) 

**Defense Technologies**

Accessible to private innovation. Trend is towards surveillance and reconnaissance relating to autonomous vehicles. 
Examples:
- Anduril (surveillance and reconnaissance)
- Shield AI (mft autonomous drones for surveillance and patrolling)
- Epirus (counter UAV systems, precision detection systems to detect unauthorized vessels, smart control of energy power)
- Dedrone (counter drone platform) 

Space stack
- Launch
- Satellite operators
- Supply chain & manufacturing 
- Next gen: space logistics, eg. increase asset lifetime, refuel, move

**Offense Technologies**

Not accessible to private innovation. Trend towards electric UAVs.

2/ Transportation
- Personal: 
- Air: 
- Railway: Parallel Systems (electric, ex-Tesla engineers)
- Subterranean: Boring company (safe, fast-to-dig, low-cost transport, freight tunnels)
- Sea: Boundary Layer Technologies (electric, hydrofoiling containerships)

3/ Agriculture
