Industrials

Manufacturing frameworks
- Two filter questions to assess potential gaps in the market. Do supply chains match closely to automobile (autoindustry is good proven example)? Is there enough volume/demand to justify the capex? 
- Find large market, extremely fragmented supply base with low NPS, vertically integrate and provide better experience. You can't depend on existing networks because it affects your customer experience.

Space stack
- Launch
- Satellite operators
- Supply chain & manufacturing 
- Next gen: space logistics, eg. increase asset lifetime, refuel, move

Observations in manufacturing
- Optimization is really hard from the outside. Industrials need software from the start.
- There are areas of mft that are extremely well optimized from competition, volume and incremental technologies over decades (eg. P&G, automobile)
- Space: long history of low volume and low demand. There are preferences and advantages to manual engineering to ensure high quality products. Never enough demand to justify investing CAPEX into assembly lines.

How to ideate 
1/ Brute force over every mft subindustry in the US, what are the margins, how fragmented is it, what are the segments, what are the trends, where is the biggest technology delta, where is the mission and end goal 
2/ Right tech stack, putting a team together, make as much upfront work as possible

Composite materials: stronger, lighter, faster, safer.

**US Departments**

1/ Defense (Army, Navy, Airforce) 

**Defense Technologies**

Accessible to private innovation. Trend is towards surveillance and reconnaissance relating to autonomous vehicles. 

Examples:
- Anduril (surveillance and reconnaissance)
- Shield AI (mft autonomous drones for surveillance and patrolling)
- Epirus (counter UAV systems, precision detection systems to detect unauthorized vessels, smart control of energy power)
- Dedrone (counter drone platform) 

**Offense Technologies**

Not accessible to private innovation. Trend towards electric UAVs.

2/ Transportation
- Personal: 
- Air: 
- Railway: Parallel Systems (electric, ex-Tesla engineers)
- Subterranean: Boring company (safe, fast-to-dig, low-cost transport, freight tunnels)
- Sea: Boundary Layer Technologies (electric, hydrofoiling containerships)

3/ Agriculture 

3/ Energy 

4/ Urban Development 

5/ Homeland Security 

6/ Commerce 
- Flexport (freight sheduler by air, ocen, rail and truck)

7/ Justice  

8/ Treasury  

9/ Health and Human Services  

10/ Veteran Affairs
